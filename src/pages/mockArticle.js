      "A girl named Jillian takes her little sisters Katie and Amanda, accompanied by their doll Mary-Ellen,\n          to a puppet show of a teenager named Jimmy O'James, with Slappy the Dummy as his partner. At the show,\n          Slappy spies the twins and Jillian with Mary-Ellen.\n          Slappy then pulls the twins up on stage with Mary-Ellen and makes fun of them. The twins,\n          who are hurt by what he said,\n          take off after the show to give him a piece of their minds and Jillian has to find them.\n          While trying to find her twin sisters,\n          Jillian finds Jimmy and Slappy's dressing room and walks in on Slappy giving Jimmy a punch in the nose.\n          Jimmy tells her that he and Slappy are just working on a new act. She asks if they have seen her sisters.\n          Jimmy responds with that he has not seen them since they were on stage. After she leaves,\n          Jimmy puts Slappy to sleep and throws him out.\n          Jillian's friend Harrison finds Slappy and brings him to Jillian's house as he believes that\n          Slappy is broken and wants Jillian's dad to fix him. After a series of troublesome events,\n          Jillian and Harrison host a birthday party and try to put on a show only to have it be revealed that\n          Mary-Ellen is alive and that she re-awoke Slappy so she could marry him, but Slappy hates Mary-Ellen and\n          desires to marry Jillian. Slappy and Mary Ellen end getting cut to pieces by a saw blaze but Slappy's spirt\n          ends up possessing Jillian. Britney Crosbey and her friend, Molly Molloy, have to put up with\n          Britney's obnoxious cousin, Ethan, and his new friend Slappy, whom Ethan calls \"Mr. Bad Boy\".\n          Slappy, though, seems to be the one causing the trouble this time, and Britney decides to put\n          Slappy to sleep, after seeing that she only had to say the magic words againâ€”simple as that.\n          But then when she finds out that Slappy was reawakened by the magic words,\n          he vows revenge and comes up with a plan to use a special 'Mind-Stealer'\n          doll to make Britney into his own personal perfect slave. At the end, Britney decides to use the\n          'Mind-Stealer' doll against Slappy, whose mind gets stolen at the end of the book.\n          Slappy later makes another appearance in Dr. Maniac Vs. Robby Shwartz where he hunts down Britney and\n          Molly and cruelly has them send Robby back to Horrorland's arcade and in Say Cheese and Die Screaming\n          where after taking a picture of Madam Dooms booth Julie sees Slappy in the picture leaning against the both.\n          Trina and Daniel O'Dell's dad came home one night with the broken Slappy, which he got for free from a guy\n          which he believes is Amy's father. Shortly after that day ends, the dummy soon gets fixed by healing itself\n          all because the family read the infamous note that came with him, and soon was later named by their father\n          as \"Smiley\" and became his new favorite dummy. A part of his amazing collection. But ever since their\n          cousin Zane had decided to spend a few nights at their house once again, problems start to occur with\n          the other dummies in the form of pranks, the main one being Rocky who was first found in an event with him\n          being seen by Zane in his bedroom. In all these cases Trina and Daniel were blamed for the events which made\n          them unhappy. Later it turns out the real trouble maker is Slappy, with help from the other dummies who he\n          brought to life, which in the end becomes hell to Slappy when he is betrayed by them to protect the O'Dells.\n          However, despite seemingly being killed, the evil dummy is caught by Trina winking at her as Zane carries\n          him to the car. In the first Night Of The Living Dummy book, Twin sisters Lindy and Kris Powell are taking a\n          walk when they come across a dummy who Lindy names Slappy. Lindy decides to keep Slappy even though Kris\n          does not like Slappy. Lindy becomes a good ventriloquist and Kris gets jealous. So, Kris gets a dummy named\n          Mr. Wood and from there on bad things start happening. Mr. Wood is defeated by the end after getting crushed\n          to death by a steamroller. However, Slappy then comes alive and grabs Kris as she is going to shut the window.\n          Unlike other books, Slappy never causes any trouble despite being alive until the end.",
